## Library overview 

A simple visual comparison of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods is often not sufficient to decide which explanation method works best as shown exemplarily in Figure a) for four gradient-based methods â€” Saliency ([MÃ¸rch et al., 1995](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/488997); [Baehrens et al., 2010](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume11/baehrens10a/baehrens10a.pdf)), Integrated Gradients ([Sundararajan et al., 2017](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/sundararajan17a/sundararajan17a.pdf)), GradientShap ([Lundberg and Lee, 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07874)) or FusionGrad ([Bykov et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10185)), yet it is a common practice for evaluation XAI methods in absence of ground truth data. Therefore, we developed Quantus, an easy-to-use yet comprehensive toolbox for quantitative evaluation of explanations â€” including 30+ different metrics.

With Quantus, we can obtain richer insights on how the methods compare e.g., b) by holistic quantification on several evaluation criteria and c) by providing sensitivity analysis of how a single parameter e.g. the pixel replacement strategy of a faithfulness test influences the ranking of the XAI methods.
 
### Metrics

This project started with the goal of collecting existing evaluation metrics that have been introduced in the context of XAI research â€” to help automate the task of _XAI quantification_. Along the way of implementation, it became clear that XAI metrics most often belong to one out of six categories i.e., 1) faithfulness, 2) robustness, 3) localisation 4) complexity 5) randomisation or 6) axiomatic metrics. The library contains implementations of the following evaluation metrics:

</details>

Additional metrics will be included in future releases. Please [open an issue](https://github.com/understandable-machine-intelligence-lab/Quantus/issues/new/choose) if you have a metric you believe should be apart of Quantus.

**Disclaimers.** It is worth noting that the implementations of the metrics in this library have not been verified by the original authors. Thus any metric implementation in this library may differ from the original authors. Further, bear in mind that evaluation metrics for XAI methods are often empirical interpretations (or translations) of qualities that some researcher(s) claimed were important for explanations to fulfil, so it may be a discrepancy between what the author claims to measure by the proposed metric and what is actually measured e.g., using entropy as an operationalisation of explanation complexity. Please read the [user guidelines](https://quantus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guidelines/guidelines_and_disclaimers.html) for further guidance on how to best use the library. 

## Installation

If you already have [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) or [TensorFlow](https://www.TensorFlow.org) installed on your machine, 
the most light-weight version of Quantus can be obtained from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/quantus/) as follows (no additional explainability functionality or deep learning framework will be included):

```setup
pip install quantus
```
Alternatively, you can simply add the desired deep learning framework (in brackets) to have the package installed together with Quantus.
To install Quantus with PyTorch, please run:
```setup
pip install "quantus[torch]"
```

For TensorFlow, please run:

```setup
pip install "quantus[tensorflow]"
```

Alternatively, you can simply install Quantus with [requirements.txt](https://github.com/understandable-machine-intelligence-lab/Quantus/blob/main/requirements.txt).
Note that this installation requires that either [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) or [TensorFlow](https://www.TensorFlow.org) are already installed on your machine.

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For a more in-depth guide on how to install Quantus, please read more [here](https://quantus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/installation.html). This includes instructions for how to install a desired deep learning framework such as PyTorch or TensorFlow together with Quantus.

### Package requirements

The package requirements are as follows:
```
python>=3.7.0
pytorch>=1.10.1
TensorFlow==2.6.2
```

## Getting started

The following will give a short introduction to how to get started with Quantus. Note that this example is based on the [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) framework, but we also support 
[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org), which would differ only in the loading of the model, data and explanations. To get started with Quantus, you need:
* A model (`model`), inputs (`x_batch`) and labels (`y_batch`)
* Some explanations you want to evaluate (`a_batch`)


<details>
<summary><b><big>Step 1. Load data and model</big></b></summary>

Let's first load the data and model. In this example, a pre-trained LeNet available from Quantus 
for the purpose of this tutorial is loaded, but generally, you might use any Pytorch (or TensorFlow) model instead. To follow this example, one needs to have quantus and torch installed, by e.g., `pip install 'quantus[torch]'`.

```python
import quantus
from quantus.helpers.model.models import LeNet
import torch
import torchvision
from torchvision import transforms
  
# Enable GPU.
device = torch.device("cuda:0" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

# Load a pre-trained LeNet classification model (architecture at quantus/helpers/models).
model = LeNet()
if device.type == "cpu":
    model.load_state_dict(torch.load("tests/assets/mnist", map_location=torch.device('cpu')))
else: 
    model.load_state_dict(torch.load("tests/assets/mnist"))

# Load datasets and make loaders.
test_set = torchvision.datasets.MNIST(root='./sample_data', download=True, transforms=transforms.Compose([transforms.ToTensor()]))
test_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(test_set, batch_size=24)

# Load a batch of inputs and outputs to use for XAI evaluation.
x_batch, y_batch = iter(test_loader).next()
x_batch, y_batch = x_batch.cpu().numpy(), y_batch.cpu().numpy()
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b><big>Step 2. Load explanations</big></b></summary>

We still need some explanations to evaluate. 
For this, there are two possibilities in Quantus. You can provide either:
1. a set of re-computed attributions (`np.ndarray`)
2. any arbitrary explanation function (`callable`), e.g., the built-in method `quantus.explain` or your own customised function

We show the different options below.

#### Using pre-computed explanations

Quantus allows you to evaluate explanations that you have pre-computed, 
assuming that they match the data you provide in `x_batch`. Let's say you have explanations 
for [Saliency](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6034) and [Integrated Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01365)
already pre-computed.

In that case, you can simply load these into corresponding variables `a_batch_saliency` 
and `a_batch_intgrad`:

```python
a_batch_saliency = load("path/to/precomputed/saliency/explanations")
a_batch_saliency = load("path/to/precomputed/intgrad/explanations")
```

Another option is to simply obtain the attributions using one of many XAI frameworks out there, 
such as [Captum](https://captum.ai/), 
[Zennit](https://github.com/chr5tphr/zennit), 
[tf.explain](https://github.com/sicara/tf-explain),
or [iNNvestigate](https://github.com/albermax/innvestigate). The following code example shows how to obtain explanations ([Saliency](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6034) 
and [Integrated Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01365), to be specific) 
using [Captum](https://captum.ai/):

```python
import captum
from captum.attr import Saliency, IntegratedGradients

# Generate Integrated Gradients attributions of the first batch of the test set.
a_batch_saliency = Saliency(model).attribute(inputs=x_batch, target=y_batch, abs=True).sum(axis=1).cpu().numpy()
a_batch_intgrad = IntegratedGradients(model).attribute(inputs=x_batch, target=y_batch, baselines=torch.zeros_like(x_batch)).sum(axis=1).cpu().numpy()

# Save x_batch and y_batch as numpy arrays that will be used to call metric instances.
x_batch, y_batch = x_batch.cpu().numpy(), y_batch.cpu().numpy()

# Quick assert.
assert [isinstance(obj, np.ndarray) for obj in [x_batch, y_batch, a_batch_saliency, a_batch_intgrad]]
```

#### Passing an explanation function

If you don't have a pre-computed set of explanations but rather want to pass an arbitrary explanation function 
that you wish to evaluate with Quantus, this option exists. 

For this, you can for example rely on the built-in `quantus.explain` function to get started, which includes some popular explanation methods 
(please run `quantus.available_methods()` to see which ones).  Examples of how to use `quantus.explain` 
or your own customised explanation function are included in the next section.

<img class="center" width="500" alt="drawing"  src="tutorials/assets/mnist_example.png"/>

As seen in the above image, the qualitative aspects of explanations 
may look fairly uninterpretable --- since we lack ground truth of what the explanations
should be looking like, it is hard to draw conclusions about the explainable evidence. To gather quantitative evidence for the quality of the different explanation methods, we can apply Quantus.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b><big>Step 3. Evaluate with Quantus</big></b></summary> 

Quantus implements XAI evaluation metrics from different categories, 
e.g., Faithfulness, Localisation and Robustness etc which all inherit from the base `quantus.Metric` class. 
To apply a metric to your setting (e.g., [Max-Sensitivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09392)) 
it first needs to be instantiated:

```python
metric = quantus.MaxSensitivity(nr_samples=10,
                                lower_bound=0.2,
                                norm_numerator=quantus.fro_norm,
                                norm_denominator=quantus.fro_norm,
                                perturb_func=quantus.uniform_noise,
                                similarity_func=quantus.difference)
```

and then applied to your model, data, and (pre-computed) explanations:

```python
scores = metric(
    model=model,
    x_batch=x_batch,
    y_batch=y_batch,
    a_batch=a_batch_saliency,
    device=device
)
```

#### Use quantus.explain

Alternatively, instead of providing pre-computed explanations, you can employ the `quantus.explain` function,
which can be specified through a dictionary passed to `explain_func_kwargs`.

```python
scores = metric(
    model=model,
    x_batch=x_batch,
    y_batch=y_batch,
    device=device,
    explain_func=quantus.explain,
    explain_func_kwargs={"method": "Saliency"}
)
```

#### Employ customised functions

You can alternatively use your own customised explanation function
(assuming it returns an `np.ndarray` in a shape that matches the input `x_batch`). This is done as follows:

```python
def your_own_callable(model, models, targets, **kwargs) -> np.ndarray
  """Logic goes here to compute the attributions and return an 
  explanation  in the same shape as x_batch (np.array), 
  (flatten channels if necessary)."""
  return explanation(model, x_batch, y_batch)

scores = metric(
    model=model,
    x_batch=x_batch,
    y_batch=y_batch,
    device=device,
    explain_func=your_own_callable
)
```
#### Run large-scale evaluation

Quantus also provides high-level functionality to support large-scale evaluations,
e.g., multiple XAI methods, multifaceted evaluation through several metrics, or a combination thereof. To utilise `quantus.evaluate()`, you simply need to define two things:

1. The **Metrics** you would like to use for evaluation (each `__init__` parameter configuration counts as its own metric):
    ```python
    metrics = {
        "max-sensitivity-10": quantus.MaxSensitivity(nr_samples=10),
        "max-sensitivity-20": quantus.MaxSensitivity(nr_samples=20),
        "region-perturbation": quantus.RegionPerturbation(),
    }
    ```
   
2. The **XAI methods** you would like to evaluate, e.g., a `dict` with pre-computed attributions:
    ```python
    xai_methods = {
        "Saliency": a_batch_saliency,
        "IntegratedGradients": a_batch_intgrad
    }
    ```

You can then simply run a large-scale evaluation as follows (this aggregates the result by `np.mean` averaging):

```python
import numpy as np
results = quantus.evaluate(
