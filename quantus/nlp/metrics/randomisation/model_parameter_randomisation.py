    Implementation of the Model Parameter Randomization Method by Adebayo et. al., 2018.

    The Model Parameter Randomization measures the distance between the original attribution and a newly computed
    attribution throughout the process of cascadingly/independently randomizing the model parameters of one layer
    at a time.

    Assumptions:
        - In the original paper multiple distance measures are taken: Spearman rank correlation (with and without abs),
        HOG and SSIM. We have set Spearman as the default value.
