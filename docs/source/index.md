Figure: a) Simple qualitative comparison of XAI methods is often not sufficient to distinguish which
gradient-based method — Saliency, Integrated Gradients, GradientShap or FusionGrad
is preferred. With Quantus, we can obtain richer insights on how the methods compare b) by holistic
quantification on several evaluation criteria and c) by providing sensitivity analysis of how a single parameter,
e.g., pixel replacement strategy of a faithfulness test influences the ranking of XAI methods. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06861">📑 Shortcut to paper!</a>

This documentation is complementary to the [README.md](https://github.com/understandable-machine-intelligence-lab/Quantus) in the Quantus repository and provides documentation
for how to {doc}`install </getting_started/installation>` Quantus, how to {doc}`contribute </docs_dev/CONTRIBUTING>` and details on the {doc}`API </docs_api/modules>`.
For further guidance on what to think about when applying Quantus, please read the {doc}`user guidelines </guidelines/guidelines_and_disclaimers>`. Do you want to get started? Please have a look at our simple {doc}`toy example </getting_started/getting_started_example>` with PyTorch using MNIST data.
For more examples, check the [tutorials](https://github.com/understandable-machine-intelligence-lab/Quantus/tree/main/tutorials) folder.

Quantus can be installed from PyPI (this way assumes that you have either [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) or [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org) installed on your machine):

```setup
pip install quantus
```

For a more in-depth guide on how to install Quantus, read more [here](https://quantus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/installation.html). This includes instructions for how to install a desired deep learning framework such as PyTorch or tensorflow together with Quantus.
