Figure: a) Simple qualitative comparison of XAI methods is often not sufficient to distinguish which
gradient-based method â€” Saliency, Integrated Gradients, GradientShap or FusionGrad
is preferred. With Quantus, we can obtain richer insights on how the methods compare b) by holistic
quantification on several evaluation criteria and c) by providing sensitivity analysis of how a single parameter
e.g. pixel replacement strategy of a faithfulness test influences the ranking of XAI methods.

This documentation is complementary to Quantus repository's [README.md](https://github.com/understandable-machine-intelligence-lab/Quantus) and provides documentation
for how to install Quantus (**Installation**), how to contribute to the project (**Developer Documentation**) and on the interface (**API Documentation**).
For further guidance on what to think about when applying Quantus, please read the user guidelines (**Guidelines**).

Do you want to get started? Please have a look at our simple MNIST/torch/Saliency/IntGrad toy example (**Getting started**).
For more examples, check the [tutorials](https://github.com/understandable-machine-intelligence-lab/Quantus/tree/main/tutorials) folder.

Quantus can be installed from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/quantus/)
(this way assumes that you have either `torch` or `tensorflow` already installed on your machine).

```setup
pip install quantus
```

For alternative ways to install Quantus, read more under **Installation**.
